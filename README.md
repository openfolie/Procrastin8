## About The Project
Procrastin8 isn't just a Chrome extension; it's your browser's new, highly judgmental overlord. Its sole purpose? To make sure you procrastinate properly. Forget productivity apps – this one forces you to waste time responsibly and hilariously.

### Key Features:
- **Your Personal Procrastination Coach**: Add websites to your "leisure list" and set soft and hard limits. If you try to work, Procrastin8 will slam your productivity tabs shut and remind you to enjoy your cat videos.
- **Gamification of Glorious Wasted Time**: Earn points for being focused (ironic, right?) and spend them to scroll more or gamble them away on a "Wheel of Fortune" for extra procrastination minutes.
- **Consequences That Hit Different**: Exceed your hard limit, and Procrastin8 goes full supervillain:
  - Solve a hard puzzle to unlock your favorite website.
  - Watch your desktop background transform into a neon sign screaming, "GET BACK TO WORK, YOU UTTER SLACKER!"
  - Lose all your procrastination coins if you try to delete the extension.

Procrastin8 is not just an app; it's a social experiment on human willpower, wrapped in a sarcastic, digital straitjacket. Can you waste time responsibly when an AI is literally holding your browser hostage? Procrastin8 dares you to find out.

## Built With
- Chrome Extension APIs
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Local logic for tracking, taunting, and gamification
- Git & GitHub (for collaborative delaying)

## Getting Started
Whether you're a seasoned slacker or just beginning your journey into the art of delay, here's how to get Procrastin8 up and running.

### Prerequisites
- Git
- A Chrome-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openfolie/procrastin8.git
   cd procrastin8
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Load the extension:
   - Open your browser's extension settings.
   - Enable "Developer Mode."
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `procrastin8` folder.

## Usage
Procrastin8 is simple to use:

### Setting Up Your Leisure List
1. Open the extension settings.
2. Add websites to your "leisure list" (e.g., YouTube, Reddit).
3. Set soft and hard limits for each website.

### Earning and Spending Procrastination Points
1. Earn points by staying focused on productive tasks.
2. Spend points to unlock extra procrastination minutes or gamble them on the "Wheel of Fortune."

### Passive-Aggressive Taunts
1. Receive humorous messages when you exceed your soft limit:
   - "Still here? Your deadlines are crying in the corner."
   - "Reddit is great, but your to-do list is filing for divorce."

### Hard Limit Consequences
1. Solve puzzles to unlock websites after exceeding your hard limit:
   - Sliding tile puzzles.
   - Math problems or logic challenges.
2. Face penalties for failing:
   - Loud, obnoxious sounds.
   - Desktop background changes to embarrassing messages.

### Fail-Safe Mechanisms
1. If you try to delete the extension, all your procrastination coins will be wiped.
2. Your browser will remind you of your poor choices with a final passive-aggressive message.

### Multiplayer Procrastination Challenges (Future Update)
1. Compete with friends to see who can procrastinate the most responsibly.
2. Share achievements on social media for ultimate irony.
